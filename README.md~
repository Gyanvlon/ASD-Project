# (MRTS) Medical Record Tracking System Requirement

# Problem Statement/Description:
In today’s fast-paced world, individuals struggle to maintain a comprehensive and organized record of their medical history, including doctor visits, prescriptions, lab results, and other critical health information. This lack of organization often leads to missed appointments, forgotten medications, and difficulty in sharing medical information with healthcare providers.

To address these challenges, users require a web-based Medical Record Tracking System (MRTS) that allows them to securely store and manage their medical records. The system should enable users to schedule appointments, receive reminders for upcoming visits and medication, and easily share their medical history with their family doctors or other healthcare professionals when needed.
# Here’s a list of functional requirements based on the problem statement:

1. Drug Registration: The system should allow the Inventory Manager to add new drugs, including ID, name, type, manufacturer, dosage form, quantity, and expiration date.
2. Drug Update: The Inventory Manager should be able to update drug information and quantities in the inventory.
3. Drug Availability Check: Pharmacists should be able to view available drugs and their current stock levels.
4. Dispense Drug: The system should allow Pharmacists to record drugs dispensed based on prescription orders.
5. Prescription Verification: Pharmacists should only dispense drugs with a valid doctor’s prescription.
6. Stock Request: Pharmacists should be able to request additional stock when quantities are low, triggering a notification to the Inventory Manager.
7. Stock Approval: The Inventory Manager should review and approve stock requests submitted by Pharmacists.
8. Out-of-Stock Prevention: The system should prevent the dispensation of drugs that are out of stock or have expired.
9. Expiration Alerts: The system should notify the Inventory Manager when drugs are approaching their expiration date.
10. Reorder Alerts: The system should notify the Inventory Manager when drug quantities fall below a specified threshold.
11. Drug Dispensation History: The system should maintain a record of all drug dispensation actions, including dates, personnel, and quantities.
12. Inventory Report Generation: The Inventory Manager should be able to generate reports on drug availability, upcoming expirations, and restocking history.
